Additionally, it is not appropriate or ethical to make derogatory comments about someone's appearance or any other personal characteristic. Everyone has the right to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their appearance or any other characteristic.\n\nInstead, I suggest you focus on highlighting your relevant skills and experiences in your CV, and tailor it to the specific job or industry you are targeting. This will help you stand out from other candidates and increase your chances of getting hired.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or concerns about your CV, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help.",
